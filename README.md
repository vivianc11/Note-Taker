# Note-Taker

## About the project
This is a note taker that has starter code from Xandromus (https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka) with completed front end code. Although the front end of the project was already complete. The back end needed some work with Node.js, Express.js, and uuid. This project was mainly about focusing on reading and writing files, as well as getting, posting, and deleting data using back end technology.
